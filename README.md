# HR Data Analyst

### Learning Outcomes:
Conduct data analysis and handle a case that resembles the actual tasks a data 
analyst may encounter at their job. Master data merging, grouping, aggregation 
functions, and draw up pivot tables using the pandas functionality.

### About
You work as an analyst in a company. The company's HR boss provided you with 
three datasets. The first two contain information about employees' performance 
in offices A and B: how much they work, their salaries, the number of their 
projects, departments, and so on. The third one is an extensive dataset with 
information on the employees' satisfaction with their jobs, their latest 
evaluation metrics, and the current status in the company. Your task is to 
analyze the data and answer some of the HR’s questions.
